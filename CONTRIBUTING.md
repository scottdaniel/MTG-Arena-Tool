### Electron Developter Tools

You can toggle developer tools for debugging using `Shift+Alt+D`, or using `F12` if you run from source.

### Available Scripts

#### `npm run clean`

Removes all cached local build state and reinstalls all dependencies from scratch.
This will most likely change your working tree because it requires removing and
re-creating `package-lock.json`.

Convenience script to remove `node_modules`.

##### `npm run clean:lock`

Convenience script to remove `package-lock.json`.

#### `npm install`

#### `npm run format`

Automatically formats all source code to match project guidelines. We currently use
`prettier` and `eslint` to keep things looking tidy.

#### `npm test`

Runs all project tests. This includes unit tests run via `jest` and style guidelines
enforced by `eslint` and `prettier`.

##### `npm run test:eslint`

Tests all source code against project `eslint` style guidelines.

Launches electron and runs the app in the development mode.

You will also see output from the main electron process in the console.

#### `npm run dist`

Builds a packaged version of the project for potential distribution.

### Optional Git Hooks
You can optionally install git hooks to help with code formatting and
ensuring that your commits build successfully. Note that these can
sometimes take a moment to run and will potentially modify files in your
working tree. For more information, [see the git hooks documentation.](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks)

#### Pre-Commit Hook
This automatically reformats all files with staged changes to match the
project guidelines.

To install (or update), run the following commands in a terminal. WARNING: this will overwrite any previous custom
git hook.
```
rm .git/hooks/pre-commit
./git-pre-commit.sh
```
This will run the hook and place a copy in your `.git/hooks/` folder.
Future commits will always run the hook.

To uninstall:
```
rm .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

#### Pre-Push Hook
This automatically checks all modified files against the project
guidelines and only allows you to push valid commits.

To install (or update), run the following commands in a terminal. WARNING: this will overwrite any previous custom
git hook.
```
rm .git/hooks/pre-push
./git-pre-push.sh
```
This will run the hook and place a copy in your `.git/hooks/` folder.
Future pushes will always run the hook.

To uninstall:
```
rm .git/hooks/pre-push
```
